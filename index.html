                        Hired by the parent company of Crown Point Pharmacy to do preliminary data collection and analysis for them. They
                        weren't commited to hiring a professional full-time and I offered to do it part-time as a student. They got to 
                        learn the benefits of having an analyst on the team and I obtained important, real-world experience.
